Samba 4 is still feature incomplete. If you are using it for anything other
than education you are insane, or perhaps just very interested.

We welcome your testing, please file bug reports at
https://bugzilla.samba.org/, product: Samba4.  Please include as much
information as possible, such as SVN revision number and backtraces.

Feature requests:
Implement a multicall binary
Backport features from GPL3 version with permission to license GPL2+
Simplify code base and documentation.
